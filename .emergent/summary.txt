<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack emotional therapy application from scratch, moving from initial MVP to a robust, feature-rich system. The development followed a phased approach: core chat functionality, user management, and finally, monetization. Initial challenges included OpenAI API integration issues, which were swiftly resolved. The engineer then focused on implementing a comprehensive user system with authentication (JWT), subscription plans (Stripe integration planned, but not fully active for payment processing), message limits, and a detailed admin dashboard.

Subsequent iterations primarily addressed bug fixes and feature enhancements based on user feedback. Critical issues like AI memory persistence across sessions, UI/UX improvements (e.g., text visibility, cancellation button styling), and the robustness of the message counting system were systematically tackled. A significant strategic decision was to implement data export/import endpoints to facilitate future migration from the Emergent platform, addressing user concerns about data portability. The current work involves refining AI behavior (handling depression queries appropriately, accessing all historical data) and adding a forgot password feature. The engineer consistently demonstrated a methodical, iterative problem-solving approach, testing frequently and responding directly to user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an emotional therapy application using AI. Core requirements included user registration and login, a chat interface with an OpenAI-powered AI, adherence to Ramana Maharshi's who am I methodology, saving session history in a database for AI context in subsequent sessions, and Stripe integration for payments. The AI must summarize interactions and store them.

Key feature additions throughout development:
- **Core Chat MVP:** Functional AI chat with a responsive, gradient-based UI.
- **User Management:** Login/registration with email/password, user profiles (name, phone, email, password change), and a list of past session summaries.
- **Subscription Plans:** 7 free messages/month. Paid plans (Basic: R.90/month for 7 msgs/day, Premium: R9.90/month for 30 msgs/day, Unlimited: R9.00/month for âˆž msgs/day). A modal to prompt subscription when messages are exhausted.
- **Billing Management:** A dedicated screen for users to view past payments and a subtle Cancel Subscription link.
- **Admin Master Dashboard:** Single admin user with access to:
    - User management (search by name/email).
    - User detail view with tabs for Plans (manage/refund), Profile (view/edit), and History (view all sessions and summaries).
    - Admin Prompts: A screen to view/edit the base system prompt for the GPT model.
    - Documents: Separate fields for a general theories document (GPT context) and a support document (GPT context for support queries, which should not consume message limits).
- **Data Persistence & Migration:** Data must be long-term persistent. The ability to export all user data and sessions, and import them into another platform, was explicitly requested to support future migration to a self-hosted environment (e.g., Render/Vercel with MongoDB Atlas).
- **AI Behavior Refinements:**
    - AI must access *all* prior session summaries for context.
    - AI should not record empty sessions (0 messages).
    - AI should respond empathetically to sensitive topics like depression, offering support while advising professional help, rather than outright refusing.
    - Implement a Forgot Password feature with email.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Forgot Password Feature:** This involves adding backend endpoints for password reset requests (e.g., sending email with token) and a corresponding frontend flow.
- **Finalize Admin Prompts UI/Content:** While the backend structure is in place, the user noted that prompts are loaded but can be improved (implying content or presentation issues).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing four specific issues reported by the user:

1.  **Recording Empty Sessions:** The backend function responsible for generating and saving session summaries () was modified to only save summaries for sessions that contain at least one message (i.e., ). This prevents unnecessary empty entries in the user's session history.
2.  **GPT Context Retrieval:** The AI was only retrieving the last three sessions, and not incorporating the admin's base theory document. The  function was updated to fetch *all* previous session summaries for the user from the database and to explicitly include the content of the admin's base theories document as part of the initial context provided to the GPT model before it formulates its first response in a new session. This ensures the AI has a comprehensive understanding of the user's history and adheres to the general therapeutic framework.
3.  **GPT Depression Response:** The AI's previous response to sensitive topics like depression was too dismissive, telling the user it cannot help. The  function has been refined to guide the AI to respond empathetically, stating it can help with conversation, giving tips, and offering emotional support, while also advising the user to seek professional help. This change aligns the AI's behavior with the desired supportive tone.

The engineer has confirmed that the first three points (empty sessions, full GPT context, and empathetic depression response) have been addressed and is now moving to the fourth item.
